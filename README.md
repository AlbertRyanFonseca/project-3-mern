# Supply Interchange LA 

Supply Interchange LA is an app that allows for the exchange of used/leftover/discount art supplies and related materials
and tools.

Registered users will be able to post items to a simple UI by category with description and basic contact information in order to connect with other users while not an e-commerce app per site will include a donation button to help fund this free service.
